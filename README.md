# Empty Fridge
An empty fridge doesn't mean you have to starve...with our app

We're poor college students and we're always hungry. There have been way too many times where we're starving and there are only a couple of things left in our fridge/pantry, and we have no idea what we can make with these ingredients. Enter Empty Fridge. It's an app that allows us to type in a list of ingredients that we currently have and outputs information about a recipe that we can create as well as other delicious info. that'll get you pumped.
